# Implementation of A* algorithm for a rigid robot. 

# Author: Prateek Verma (118435039)

Github link: https://github.com/prateekvrma/Astar-PathPlanning-RigidRobot.git

## Dependencies
Python 3.7
Numpy      (For numerical computation)
Math       (For Mathematical Operations)
OpenCV     (For Visualization)
Matplotlib 

## Steps for Execution
Step <1> Clone the folder from the git repository.

Step <2> Go to the folder location in the terminal.

Step <3> Run the python file with the following command :

 python prateek_verma.py 

Step <4> Next enter values for start (x,y) and goal (x,y) positions and wait for the code to execute. 

Example Inputs:

Initial position (x y): 20 20

Initial Orientation (in degrees): 0

Target position (x y): 200 200

Goal Orientation (in degrees): 0

Step size: 10

Robot Radius: 10

Clearance: 5

(Please be patient as it may take a while to visualize the output)

Step <5> At last you will see the output: Visualization Complete.

## Results
The output video generated.
