# Astar-PathPlanning-RigidRobot
# Implementation of A* algorithm for a rigid robot. 

## Dependencies
Python 3.7
Numpy      (For numerical computation)
Math       (For Mathematical Operations)
OpenCV     (For Visualization)
Matplotlib 

## Steps for Execution
1. Clone the folder from the git repository.
2. Go to the folder location in the terminal.
3. Run the python file with the following command :

 python prateek_verma.py 

4. Next enter values for start (x,y) and goal (x,y) positions and wait for the code to execute. 

Example Inputs:

Initial position (x y): 20 20
Initial Orientation (in degrees): 0
Target position (x y): 200 200
Goal Orientation (in degrees): 0
Step size: 10
Robot Radius: 10
Clearance: 5

(Please be patient as it may take a while to visualize the output)

5. At last you will see the output: Visualization Complete.

## Results
The output video generated.
